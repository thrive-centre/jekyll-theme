# Biography

I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the University of West London, working within the Intelligent Sensing and Vision (IntSaV) research group under the supervision of senior faculty. My research focuses on applying artificial intelligence to cardiac imaging, with a particular emphasis on echocardiographic image quality assessment.

My journey into AI and data science began with a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Benin, where I first explored using evolutionary algorithms for heart disease prediction. This early interest in healthcare applications led me to pursue an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and its Applications at the University of Essex. During my MSc, I co-authored a paper on skin cancer prediction using deep learning, which was published at the IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM). Our research contributed to the ISIC Challenge and focused on developing an improved Vision Transformer Network for skin cancer classification, highlighting the potential of AI in early disease detection.

Throughout my career, I've balanced academic pursuits with practical industry experience. I've worked across diverse sectors—from blockchain and Web3 at Nethermind to AI research at Agentsmith—developing data-driven solutions and predictive models. This blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application has shaped my approach to research, emphasizing solutions that bridge the gap between advanced algorithms and real-world clinical needs.

My current PhD work contributes to the UNITY Biobank project, a groundbreaking initiative to create the UK's largest open-access repository of echocardiographic images. I'm specifically focused on developing methods to assess and improve image quality in the Parasternal Long Axis (PLAX) view, addressing challenges in border visibility, foreshortening, valve visibility, and orientation.

Beyond my research, I'm passionate about education and knowledge sharing. As an Academic Assistant at the University of West London, I support MSc students in data science, computer vision and deep learning, guiding them through practical applications and research projects. I've also volunteered as a data science tutor an experience that have enhanced my ability to communicate complex concepts to diverse audiences.

I believe in the transformative potential of AI in healthcare, particularly in improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making. Through my research and teaching, I aim to contribute to the development of intelligent systems that can make quality healthcare more accessible and effective for all.
