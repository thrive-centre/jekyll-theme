# Biography

I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the University of West London, working under the supervision of Professor Massoud Zolgharni and Dr. Sama Aleshaiker where my research focuses on applying AI to healthcare, particularly in developing intelligent systems for patient diagnosis and clinical decision support.

My path into AI builds on over 15 years of experience in IT infrastructure and systems engineering, including senior roles in Iran's energy sector. Managing complex computing environments sparked my interest in intelligent systems that could automate diagnostics and improve decision-making.

I’ve always had a deep appreciation for programming and open-source software. I work with languages like Python and TypeScript, and I’m comfortable across the full stack, from backend APIs to modern frontend frameworks like Svelte. My DevOps toolkit includes Linux/BSD systems, Docker, Kubernetes, and infrastructure monitoring like Zabbix.

Outside of academia and work, I’ve been a long-time advocate for free and open-source software. I see education, collaboration, and open access as vital pillars of innovation.

As I advance in my research, my goal is to help bridge the gap between AI theory and practical, life-saving tools in the medical field, making smart, fair, and effective healthcare a global standard
