# Biography

I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the University of West London, under the supervision of Professor Massoud Zolgharni and Dr. Nasim Dadashiserej. My research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Medical Image Processing, with a particular focus on developing intelligent systems for Image Quality Assessment of echocardiographic images. The overarching aim of my work is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support clinical decision-making through AI-driven analysis.

With a strong appreciation for programming and open-source technologies, I actively work with languages such as Python, C, and shell scripting. My development and deployment toolkit includes Linux/BSD systems, Docker, and TensorFlow, reflecting a DevOps-oriented approach to research and experimentation.

My long-term research goal is to contribute to the creation of robust, explainable, and generalizable AI solutions that can be seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, improving patient outcomes and supporting evidence-based medical practices.
