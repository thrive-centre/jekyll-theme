# Biography

I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the University of West London, working under the supervision of Professor Massoud Zolgharni and Dr. Hanieh Khalili. My academic background is in Chemical Engineering; I completed my MSc at the University of Tehran, where my thesis focused on nanocarrier systems for targeted drug delivery. I earned my BSc from the Iran University of Science and Technology, with a concentration in process design and simulation. My research interests lie at the intersection of drug delivery systems, 3D bioprinting, AI in biomedical engineering, and biomaterials for cancer treatment. I aim to combine computational modeling with experimental approaches to develop innovative medical solutions. I have published a peer-reviewed paper and remain passionate about advancing research that bridges engineering and healthcare.

## AI-aided design of 3D printed click-hydrogel micro implant for tissue regeneration

3D bioprinting has emerged as an essential technique in tissue engineering, capable of creating complex, porous scaffolds designed as effective carriers for therapeutic agents. These structures facilitate controlled, localised drug release directly at targeted tissue sites. Extrusion-based 3D bioprinting is widely employed due to its affordability, adaptability, and compatibility with various biomaterials. However, achieving optimal scaffold printability and structural integrity requires careful optimization of biomaterial properties, including their biological, mechanical, and rheological characteristics.
we aim to leverage extrusion-based 3D bioprinting techniques to fabricate scaffolds with precise shapes and sizes for localised drug delivery applications. To accelerate the process and reduce experimentation costs, machine learning methods will be employed to identify optimal printing configurations, ultimately advancing the effectiveness and efficiency of scaffold-based drug delivery systems.
