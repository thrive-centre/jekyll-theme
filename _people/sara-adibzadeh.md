# Biography

I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the University of West London, working under the supervision of Professor Massoud Zolgharni, Dr Ali Gheitasy, and Dr Nasim Dadashi Serej. With a background in Computing and Engineering, my research focuses on designing human-AI interaction systems for medical image analysis, with the goal of advancing healthcare through intelligent, clinician-centered technologies.

I am particularly interested in how user-centered design (UCD), real-time AI feedback, and intuitive interface design can improve diagnostic accuracy, support clinical decision-making, and reduce cognitive workload in clinical practice.

My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in software and design engineering, interdisciplinary research, and the application of advanced methodologies at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), human-AI interaction, artificial intelligence, clinical usability, and digital health
