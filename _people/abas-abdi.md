# Biography

I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the **University of West London (UWL)**, supervised by **Professor Massoud Zolgharni** and **Dr Nasim Dadashi Serej**.  
My doctoral work develops *deep-learning point-tracking* techniques that yield precise **regional left-ventricular (LV) strain** estimates in both synthetic benchmarks and clinical echocardiograms.

# Qualifications
- Computer Science, University of West London — **PhD (ongoing)**
- Computer Science, University of West London — **BSc (Hons), First-Class**, 2022

# Supervisors
[Professor Massoud Zolgharni](https://www.uwl.ac.uk/staff/massoud-zolgharni)  
[Dr Nasim Dadashi Serej](https://www.uwl.ac.uk/staff/nasim-dadashi-serej)

# Research Projects
- **Deep-Learning Point Tracking for Regional LV Strain** – creating a lightweight, coarse-to-fine neural tracker that follows myocardial landmarks through the cardiac cycle to produce accurate **LV strain curves** in synthetic and clinical data.

# Selected Publications
- **Pre-training of U-Net Encoder for Improved Keypoint Detection in Transmitral Doppler Imaging**, *MIDL 2024 Short Papers*, 2024 :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Generalized Polyp Detection from Colonoscopy Frames Using Proposed EDF-YOLO8 Network**, *CaPTion 2024 (LNCS 15199)*, 2024 :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

# Research Interests
- AI for cardiovascular ultrasound  
- Learning-based point tracking & optical flow  
- **Regional LV strain estimation**  
- Synthetic-to-clinical domain adaptation  
- Self-supervised & active learning in medical imaging  

# Teaching & Research
